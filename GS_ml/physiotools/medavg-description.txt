 The SMOOTH function implements a method known as (3RSR)2H twice (see
 Reference) to do a running median averaging.  For the sake of convient
 programming, SMOOTH calls 3 smaller functions:

 R3R:  to implement repeated running median
 SR:   to implement splitting 2-wide peaks and valleys
 H:    to implement hanning

 These are helper functions, and should not be run directly.
