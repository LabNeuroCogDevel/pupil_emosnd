I feel like I'm up against the world
I am respected by my peers
I wish I were a better person
I have a good sense of humor
My future looks bright
No one understands me
I will be successful
I'm fun to be with
I've let people down
I can't finish anything
It's just not worth it
I am in a great mood
There are many people who care about me
My future is bleak
I'm proud of my accomplishments
There must be something wrong with me
I will finish what I start
I have many good qualities
I'm so weak
I am comfortable with life
I'm no good
I have a good way with others
Why can't I ever succeed 
I feel so helpless
My life is not going the way I want it to
I am a lucky person
I have friends who support me
Life is exciting
I'm so disappointed in myself
I enjoy a challenge
Nothing feels good anymore
I can't stand this anymore
I can't get started
What's wrong with me?
I don't think I can go on
My social life is terrific
I wish I were somewhere else
There's nothing to worry about
I'm so relaxed 
I can't get things together
I hate myself
My life is running smoothly
I'm worthless
I wish I could just disappear
I'm happy with the way I look
What's the matter with me?
I take good care of myself
I deserve the best in life
I'm a loser
Bad days are rare
I have many useful qualities
There is no problem that is hopeless
I won't give up.
My life is a mess
I'm a failure
I'll never make it
I state opinions with confidence
Something has to change
My life keeps getting better
Today I've accomplished a lot.
